# Cancer-Prediction-Datascience-Project
The Cancer Prediction and Classification project aims to develop a Machine Learning based system for the prediction of the Diagnosis of the Cancer. 
## Problem Statement:
The problem I’m about to address from the Cancer Prediction Dataset is the accurate detection and classification of cancer cases. The  dataset aims to provide the necessary information and attributes regarding cancer patients enabling Machine Learning(ML) models to predict whether a tumour is Benign(B) or Malignant(M) from the diagnosis column based on the patient features. 
## Solution Approach:
The solution for the problem hereby involves leveraging the Cancer Dataset to develop Machine Learning models for cancer detection by using classification. By analysing the provided patient features such as tumour sizes  and outcome, models can be trained to accurately classify tumours as  Benign(B) or Malignant(M). The dataset serves as the foundation for building and evaluating these models.
## Observation:
The Cancer Dataset offers insights into the characteristics and attributes of cancer patients. By examining the dataset, we can observe the patterns and relationships between the provided features and resulting tumour classification  from diagnosis column. This can help in understanding the factor that contribute to development and progression of cancer and assist in identifying potential risk factor or indicators
## Insights:
Analyzing the cancer dataset,we can provide the valuable insights into the following areas:
1. ### Feature Importance:
   By studying the correlation and significance of each feature with the tumour classification, we can gain insights into which attributes play a crucial role in determining whether a tumour is Benign(B) or Malignant(M). This information can aid in understanding the key factors contributing to cancer progression.
2. ### •	Treatment Outcomes:
   By examining the treatment and outcome data, we can gain insights into the effectiveness of different treatment approaches and their impact on patient outcomes.This can help identify patterns in successful treatments and guide future treatment strategies.
