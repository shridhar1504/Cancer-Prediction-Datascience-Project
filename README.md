# Cancer-Prediction-Datascience-Project
The Cancer Prediction and Classification project aims to develop a Machine Learning based system for the prediction of the Diagnosis of the Cancer. 
## Problem Statement:
The problem Iâ€™m about to address from the Cancer Prediction Dataset is the accurate detection and classification of cancer cases. The  dataset aims to provide the necessary information and attributes regarding cancer patients enabling Machine Learning(ML) models to predict whether a tumour is Benign(B) or Malignant(M) from the diagnosis column based on the patient features.
